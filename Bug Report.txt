Bug Report
Title:

Stepper progress shows incorrect percentage for the current step

Environment:

Application: Stepper form

Browser: (add your browser here)

Test automation: Playwright

Steps to Reproduce:

Open the form that contains the stepper progress bar.

Navigate to step 2 of the form.

Inspect the progress bar element (data-current-progress).

Compare it to the expected progress value for the current step.

Expected Result:

For step 2, the element data-current-progress should display 40%.
Progress mapping should be:

Step 1 → 20%

Step 2 → 40%

Step 3 → 60%

Step 4 → 80%

Step 5 → 100%

The data-form-progress-current-step value should correctly reflect the step number.

Actual Result:

On step 2, the data-current-progress value is incorrectly shown as 20% instead of 40%.
The progress bar displays the previous step’s progress value.

Impact:

Incorrect visual feedback for users

Automated tests fail due to mismatched logic

Potential confusion and wrong step completion tracking

Severity:

Medium — Functionality works, but user experience and automated validation are significantly affected.
